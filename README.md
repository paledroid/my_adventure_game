# Adventure Game Project

Udacity project to create a text-based adventure game in Python.

This was my second Udacity project on the [Introduction to Programming nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000).

The objective was to create a simple game (executable from the terminal) which gave the player a small number of choices in responding to a small number of fixed situations.

### Example game

Udacity provided an example game in the course materials, which ran from an embedded Terminal running the BASH shell on their lesson page.

If you have access to the Introduction to Programming course at Udacity, you can find a link to the example game [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/5cf8fdc6-98d2-427e-b203-c53fe3c94d31/modules/22df73b4-a18f-44b4-878d-b8226651c1bf/lessons/47f497c5-b52b-432e-b723-9f2504779585/concepts/50e0b95f-1b4f-4607-a00a-3e8d2e49e370).

## Installing the game

The game runs directly from the BASH Shell which is accessible via the Terminal:

```python3
python3 my_adventure_game.py
```

### Testing 

`My_adventure_game` was tested in the Terminal of an iMac mid-2011 running High Sierra version 10.13.6.

## Project Specification

### Project Rubric 

The project included a specification and design and code quality critera to meet.

If you have access to the course, the specification can be found [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2465/view).

### Udacity style guide

The code was written to follow the standard Python Style Code.

## Project review

The project was tested against `pycodestyle` to ensure there were no warnings or errors. 

The project met all the requirements.
